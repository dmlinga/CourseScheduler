This project involves the development of course scheduling software for university. 
The system enables users to input course information, course name, code, section number, credit hours, lecture frequency, instructor name, location, start-time and end-time. 
The system allows the users to view all the available courses, select desired courses, and generate a weekly timetable according to the section, frequency and time. 
Additionally, the system allows users to add and remove courses from the weekly timetable. 
Through requirement analysis and engineering, design, implementation, and testing the system offers user-friendly interface for course scheduling.
